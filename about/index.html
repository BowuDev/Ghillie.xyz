                        <h1 style="margin-left: -6em; margin-top: 3.5em; text-align:left;">A little bit about me</h1>
                        <p style="margin-left: -15em; text-align:left;">I am a highly skilled digital designer with a
                            passion for
                            creating movie
                            posters, album covers, and
                            thumbnails.<br>
                            With a keen eye for detail and an ability to quickly adapt to any design software,<br>
                            I am confident in my ability to bring my clients' visions to life.<br>
                            As a problem solver, I approach design challenges by taking a step back and gaining new
                            perspectives,<br>
                            ensuring the best outcome for my clients.<br>
                            My work with Daily Dose of Internet, a YouTube channel with over 15 million subscribers,<br>
                            has been one of my biggest achievements to date.<br>
                            In terms of software, I specialize in Photoshop and pride myself on staying up-to-date with
                            the latest design trends and strategies.
                            When I'm not designing, I enjoy playing and coding games, which helps fuel my
                            creativity.<br>
                            Looking ahead, my long-term goal is to turn my passion for digital design into a full-time
                            career that can support my family.
                            Collaboration is essential to my process, and I always make sure to share updates and
                            progress with
                            my<br>
                            clients to
                            ensure their input is valued throughout the project.<br></p>
